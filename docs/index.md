# Welcome to Super JSS Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of Super JSS, the dynamic CSS library for Angular that is revolutionizing the way you apply styles to your applications. Inspired by the dynamic capabilities of UI libraries like Material UI, Styled Components, and Vuetify, Super JSS extends these concepts within the Angular ecosystem, which traditionally lacked such dynamic styling approaches. Built using the latest features of Angular 16, Super JSS leverages the power of signals, making state management for styles incredibly easy, fast, and intuitive. With Super JSS, you can effortlessly create responsive, themeable, and highly customizable user interfaces using the power and simplicity of JavaScript.

## What is Super JSS?

**Super JSS** (Super JavaScript Stylesheets) is a cutting-edge library that brings the power of JavaScript to the world of styling in Angular. By utilizing Angular 16's signals, it allows you to define your styles as JavaScript objects, providing a dynamic and powerful way to manage your application's appearance without the complexity of RxJS.

## The Philosophy Behind Super JSS

Drawing inspiration from the best practices of established UI frameworks, Super JSS is built on the belief that styling should be as dynamic and flexible as the components it styles. With the recent upgrade to Angular 16 and the removal of all RxJS dependencies, Super JSS has become even more streamlined and efficient. It's not just about applying static CSS; it's about creating a styling ecosystem that responds to user interactions, application state, and environmental changes in real-time.
