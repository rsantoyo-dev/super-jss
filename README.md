# SuperJssWorkspace

This workspace contains the SuperJss library, a powerful tool for applying styles dynamically in Angular applications. The library provides a directive that makes it easy to bind styles to elements based on various conditions and breakpoints.

## Getting Started

To run the entire project:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Working with the SuperJss Library

To work with the SuperJss library, navigate to the library's directory:

```bash
cd projects/super-jss
```

### Building the Library

To build the SuperJss library:

```bash
ng build super-jss
```

If you want to observe changes and rebuild the library automatically, use the `--watch` flag:

```bash
ng build super-jss --watch
```

## Additional Commands

- **Generate Components & More**: Use `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

- **Running Unit Tests**: Execute `ng test` to run the unit tests via Karma.

- **Running End-to-End Tests**: Execute `ng e2e` to run the end-to-end tests. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
